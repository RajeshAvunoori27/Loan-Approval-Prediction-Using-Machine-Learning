# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. This will help financial institutions streamline their loan approval process, reduce manual effort, and improve decision-making accuracy. It includes data preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment through a Flask web application.
